## Developing and Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (npm >= 3)
- Grunt CLI installed globally

### Setup

To get started, clone the repository and ensure you have npm >= 3 and grunt installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
grunt
```

The `grunt` command generates `example/js/blueprint3d.js` from the TypeScript sources in `src/`.

### Running Locally

The easiest way to run locally is to run a local server from the `example` directory:

```bash
cd example

# Python 3.x
python -m http.server

# Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Project Structure

### `src/` Directory

The `src` directory contains the core of the project:

- **`core/`** - Basic utilities such as logging and generic functions
- **`floorplanner/`** - 2D view/controller for editing the floorplan
- **`items/`** - Various types of items that can go in rooms
- **`model/`** - Data model representing both the 2D floorplan and all of the items in it
- **`three/`** - 3D view/controller for viewing and modifying item placement
