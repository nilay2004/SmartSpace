- **2D Floorplan Editor** - Create and edit floor plans interactively
- **3D Visualization** - View and modify your design in real-time 3D
- **Item Placement** - Add and arrange furniture and items in your space
- **Customizable** - Built as a modular library for easy integration

## Developing and Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (npm >= 3)
- Grunt CLI installed globally

### Setup

To get started, clone the repository and ensure you have npm >= 3 and grunt installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
grunt
```

The `grunt` command generates `example/js/blueprint3d.js` from the TypeScript sources in `src/`.

### Running Locally

The easiest way to run locally is to run a local server from the `example` directory:

```bash
cd example

# Python 3.x
python -m http.server

# Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Project Structure

### `src/` Directory

The `src` directory contains the core of the project:

- **`core/`** - Basic utilities such as logging and generic functions
- **`floorplanner/`** - 2D view/controller for editing the floorplan
- **`items/`** - Various types of items that can go in rooms
- **`model/`** - Data model representing both the 2D floorplan and all of the items in it
- **`three/`** - 3D view/controller for viewing and modifying item placement

### `example/` Directory

The example directory contains a complete application built using the core blueprint3d JavaScript building blocks. It includes HTML, CSS, models, textures, and integration code.

## Contributing

This project requires a lot more work. In general, it was rushed through various prototype stages and never refactored as much as it probably should be. We need your help!

Please contact us if you are interested in contributing.

### Todos

- More complete documentation (based on the TypeDoc comments)
- Test suite (e.g. jasmine)
- Make it easier to build a complete application using blueprint3d (cleaner API, more inclusive base, easier integration with a backend)
- Better serialization format for saving/loading "designs"
- Remove the dependency on jquery from the core source!
- Better use of npm conventions and packaging
- Various bug fixes
- Refactor three/* - use of classes, lambdas
- Update to current three.js
- Introduce a more formal persistency format
- Put all relevant settings into Core.Configuration to make them read-/writable
- Complete type docs for all entities
- Fix all TODO_Ekki comments
